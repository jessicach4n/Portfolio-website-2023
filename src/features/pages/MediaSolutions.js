                <h2>The project</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I created a short animation of Media Solutions' brand identity that
                    reflects their brand's identity. This animation is designed to be played at the
                    beginning of any presentation such as events, customer meetings, promos, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, a web application presenting some of the organizationâ€™s projects was
                    made along with the animation. This prototype remains consistent with the DNA
                    of the brand.
                </p>
