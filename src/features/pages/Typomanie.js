                        The role of this mobile application is to diagnose the user with typomania,  
                        the fictitious syndrome of a graphic designer possessed by a fixation on typography. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the game is designed to frustrate the user by inducing the effects  of typomania 
                        such as frustration and anger. While the player doesnâ€™t admit  that they are suffering from the syndrome, 
                        the game will restart from the  beginning. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To further push the impression that the application is playing against the user, 
                        the game is designed to glitch a few times by simulating the appearance of corrupted 
                        pixels every 0.2 second.
