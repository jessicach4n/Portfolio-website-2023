                <h2>The project</h2>
                <p>
                    This project consists of designing an animation that supports the narrator and illustrates different 
                    ideas to facilitate understanding. The audio was given along with the client's mandate for students 
                    to create a storyboard that corresponds to the narration of the audio. Once approved, the student 
                    creates the animations using AfterEffects. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intention is to help the viewer visualize what is being said in order to help their comprehension 
                    of the subject presented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project allowed us to further practice timing key points in the audio with the animations and the 
                    transitions between scenes. 
                </p>
